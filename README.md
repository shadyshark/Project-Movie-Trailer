Movie Trailer is a python server-side code to store a list of favorite movies including movie title, box art URL and a YouTube link for the movie trailer to generate a web page allowing visitors to review movies and watch the trailers


## Creation method

1.Create a Python Class called _Movie_ to store favorite movies in _media.py_ file

2.Write a constructor for the movie class so that we can create instances of movie 

3.Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent favorite movies in _entertainment_center.py_ file by calling the constructor `media.Movie()` to instantiate movie objects

4.Defining the movie class and constructor __init__

5.provid a starter code that contains a Python module called _fresh_tomatoes.py_ 

6.The file _fresh_tomatoes.py_ contains the `open_movies_page()` function that will take in list of movies and generate an HTML file including this content, producing a website to showcase favorite movies.
